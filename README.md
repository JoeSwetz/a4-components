NOTE: the final code is located in the Glitch branch (which is the one specified in this pull request, I just wanted to
say this here to make sure you don't look at master, since the Glitch branch has some slight differences for being deployed
on Glitch).

I chose the Components assignment for A4, recreating the front-end of my application in React. I didn't add or change
any functionality since the objective of the assignment was to recreate the same functionality as my A3 assignment. Since I had
no prior experience with React and had to learn it from the beginning on my own, which resulted in a lot of time trying
to figure out the mundane aspects of the assignment. That being said, I think if I tried to develop an application in
React now it would be a much better experience. The flexibility of the components makes it easy to insert and swap out
piece of a UI and the ability to track state and props helps for components to communicate to one another.

Finally, I wanted to note a bug that I am aware of. When you select multiple rows and click to modify, those checkboxes
stay checked, but the rows are no longer selected. So to modify that row again, you would need to uncheck the row, and then
check it again. It's not a big deal, and I could have fixed it if I had more time, but I figured it was best to ensure
the main functionality was working.
